# The Reading
Welcome to the MoMo README file.

This is a school project with the main focus to display my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
Python, Flask, MongoDB and Materialize. This website's goal is for users to create, read,
update and delete book reviews. Also for the owner/owners to include affiliated sales links
to monetize the webpage and make a profit through the webpages popularity and usage. 


## UX/UI


### User Stories (UX)

As a user type, I want:

-   to be able to create, read, update and delete book reviews.

-	the webpage to be intuitive, to make usage easier and more appealing.

-   to see clear separations between my own book reviews and others.

-	to be able to purchase the book either directly via the webpage or through affiliated links.


### Owner Stories (UX)

As an owner type, I want:

-   to create a webpage that will allow users and owners to create, read, update and delete book reviews.

-   the webpage to be intuitive and appealing, which in turn will make the user want to use it
    on several accounts.

-   to be able to monetize the webpage by providing users with either selling the book directly
    on the webpage or by adding affiliated links.

- Future implementetion that would increase monetization would be to add adds to the webpage. That is not
the current focus with this project and therefore not Implemented.
